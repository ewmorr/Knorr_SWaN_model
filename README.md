The model predicts annual respiration values based on hourly temperature data series and field measurements of temperature and soil respiration.
The model takes as input temperature and respiration data as input which are archived on the Harvard Forest LTER data [repository](https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF045)
